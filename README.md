# INT104-Data-Analytic
This is the Coursework of the INT104 Artificial Intelligence module.
# Background
The goal of this project is to evaluate the physical condition of patients by designing a questionnaire with 15 questions and to determine the appropriate anesthesia method based on the scores of each question. A spreadsheet with scores from over 5000 patients is provided, with the results labeled as '0', '1', and a few as '2'. Students are required to design a classifier to categorize patients into the corresponding results based on the scores for each question.
